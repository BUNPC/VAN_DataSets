## Graphs

[Graph_VIDA.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/1-lgOJvdkZzEBcfY0jBfH8Fh14wcpaf1D/view?usp=sharing) is graph generated by VIDA software

[Graph_WallE.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/1SvtsH8-TAIhsW5NbOraTUjHRRxEYRAFu/view?usp=sharing) is graph generated by the Walle deep learning segmentation and skeletonization

[Corrected_graph.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/1Q2XDsbJqi-itkO1Iep8dGSZeSH4Uay8B/view?usp=sharing) contains 
the ground truth graph.

Each mat files contains a variable named Graph. 
Graph.nodes has node information and Graph.edges has edge information.

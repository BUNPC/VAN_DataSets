## Graphs

[Graph_VIDA.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/1TKWJGQw77m5uQMZzTvvq0Z8jn7bdHcCY/view?usp=sharing) is graph generated by VIDA software

[Graph_WallE.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/1kyAxBH2gJUO9tZj3MZopRasxX46ue2IT/view?usp=sharing) is graph generated by the Walle deep learning segmentation and skeletonization

[Corrected_graph.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/1Nd_lbTAv8bBhMJnj4OnypFXjp7k5NKbl/view?usp=sharing) contains 
the ground truth graph.

Each mat files contains a variable named Graph. Graph.nodes has node information, Graph.edges has edge information and Graph.diam has diameter information at each node.

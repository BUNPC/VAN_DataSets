## Graphs

[Graph_VIDA.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/161VYCdR03J-UsT61hdM2IMNdVHCoMIpu/view?usp=sharing) is graph generated by VIDA software

[Graph_WallE.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/1bdVbpIdE5MvuDqpKZfANt_6GZm8YQSpa/view?usp=sharing) is graph generated by the Walle deep learning segmentation and skeletonization

[Corrected_graph.mat](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/1d_w1LXJXmsAsEbA7TbGt76ND4AuveUfq/view?usp=sharing) contains 
the ground truth graph.

Each mat files contains a variable named Graph. Graph.nodes has node information, Graph.edges has edge information and Graph.diam has diameter information at each node.
